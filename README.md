This is a RobotC app for the Mindstorms NXT robot for the "RoboMower" challenge (version 1, of course)

For any of your lucky enough to grow up in te 90's and experience the Lego Mindstorms project (particularly the RCX and NXT bots) you will love RobotC!
Build and maintained by Carnegie Mellon University, this is a C-based library to program the NXT brick with. It also includes an incredible virtual environment
to experiment with, complete with simple learning challenges.

This is V1 of my RoboMower (Ultrasonic); using a timer to determine the turning is problamatic due to motor fatigue, power draw, etc, so I'll be updating this
to rotational/positional metrics once I become more acquainted with the RobotC library.
